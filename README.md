# Math Facts

This is a react native math facts app that I built for my kids.  I've open sourced this app as a demo and in case someone might find some utility in it. 

The react native uses the expo framework and hasn't been extended beyond being a basic expo app.  Most relevant documentation can be found at (https://docs.expo.dev/)[https://docs.expo.dev/]

## Getting started
From a terminal, navigate to the directory this folder is in and run:

```
yarn
```

Afterwards get the expo project running by running:

```
yarn start
```

Profit!
